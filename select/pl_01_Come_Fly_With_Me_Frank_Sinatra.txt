come fly with me
let's fly, let's fly away
if you can use some exotic booze
there's a bar in far bombay
come fly with me
let's fly, let's fly away
come fly with me
let's float down to peru
in llama land there's
a one-man band
and he'll toot his flute
for you
come fly with me
let's take off in the blue
once I get you up there
where the air is rarified
we'll just glide, starry-eyed
once I get you up there
i'll be holding you so near
you may hear angels cheer
cause we're together
weather-wise
it's such a lovely day
you just say the words
and we'll beat the birds
down to acapulco bay
it's perfect for a flying
honeymoon
they say come fly with me
let's fly, let's fly away
