[00:08.62] Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
[00:15.88] If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far Bombay
[00:23.23] Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
[00:30.38] Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
[00:51.38] 
[00:37.46] In Lama Land there's a one man band
[00:40.83] And he'll toot his flute for you
[00:44.77] Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue
[01:06.77] 
[00:50.97] Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
[00:59.45] We'll just glide
[01:02.76] Starry eyed
[01:05.16] Once I get you up there
[01:08.75] I'll be holding you so near
[01:14.16] You may hear the angels cheer because we're together
[01:40.16] 
[01:21.12] Weather-wise it's such a lovely day
[01:27.59] Just say the words and we'll beat those birds down to Acapulco Bay
[01:34.64] It's perfect for a flying honeymooon, they say
[01:41.65] So come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
[01:47.55] (Oh come on, let's fly)
[01:59.05] 
[02:09.78] Once I get you up there where the air is rarefied
[02:18.44] We'll just glide
[02:21.72] Starry eyed
[02:24.14] Once I get you up there
[02:26.60] I'll be holding you so near
[02:32.98] You may hear all the angels cheer because we're together
[03:00.98] 
[02:40.07] Weather-wise it's such a lovely day
[02:45.72] You just say those words and we'll beat those birds down to Acapulco Bay
[02:53.13] It's so perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
[03:00.62] Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly
[03:06.91] Pack up, let's fly away
